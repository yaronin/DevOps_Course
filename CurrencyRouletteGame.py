#   This game will use the free currency api to get the current exchange rate from USD to ILS, will
#   generate a new random number between 1-100 a will ask the user what he thinks is the value of
#   the generated number from USD to ILS, depending on the userâ€™s difficulty his answer will be
#   correct if the guessed value is between the interval surrounding the correct answer
